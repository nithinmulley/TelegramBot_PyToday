#PyTodayBOT - Telegram BOT

##Testing and Learning the BOT facility in Telegram with Python.

- Currently this bot fetches Meetups details from Hyderabad Python User Group. Supports inline and in Chat.

- Update the 'meetup_dict' dictionary to fetch details from other meetups. { 'keyword' : 'Group URL of the Meetup'}

##In Progress:-
- Planning to modify the code as it can take the meetup group details from a JSON/YAML.
- Also anyone should be able to call a function with the meetup group name.
